### Google - Audit Google Groups (fixes and tree view)
- **Fixed Cloud Identity label parsing.** GAM emits one boolean column per label (`labels.cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.security`, `labels.cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum`) holding `True` when applied, not a single serialized `labels` column. The previous regex match returned `Unknown` for every group; now `Type` (`Security` / `Email` / `Both` / `Unknown`) is correctly assigned across the tenant
- **Pared `Summary.txt` down to statistics only.** Sections now cover group type counts, membership totals broken out by role and member type, and risk flag tallies. Per-group risk drill-downs and external-member listings moved into the new `GroupTree.txt`
- **Added `GroupTree.txt`.** A visual companion to `GroupMembers.csv`: every group rendered as a heading (`[S]` / `[E]` / `[B]` / `[?]` type tag, name, email, description), risk flags rendered inline (`!! NO OWNERS | PUBLIC POST`), then every member listed beneath sorted OWNER -> MANAGER -> MEMBER. External members marked with `*`, nested members annotated with `(nested via parent-group@domain)`. Mirrors the `FolderTree.txt` pattern from the Drive audit script
- Updated `Google/README.md` script index and CHANGELOG to reflect the four-output structure (`GroupMembers.csv`, `Groups.csv`, `GroupTree.txt`, `Summary.txt`)

### Google - Audit Google Groups (update)
- Reworked output focus from counts to specific names and addresses, per vCIO request for "Group Name, email and Members"
- `GroupMembers.csv` is now the primary export: columns are `GroupName`, `GroupEmail`, `GroupType`, `MemberName` (display name), `MemberEmail`, `Role`, `MemberType`, `Status`, `Internal`, `External`, `NestedVia`
  - `MemberName` populated by adding `name` to the `gam print group-members fields` list
  - `NestedVia` populated from GAM's `subGroupEmail` column when `-ExpandNestedGroups` is used, identifying the direct-member group through which a transitively included user comes
  - `GroupName` and `GroupType` denormalized onto every row so the CSV stands alone without requiring a join to `Groups.csv`
- `Groups.csv` now includes `OwnerEmails`, `ManagerEmails`, and `ExternalMemberEmails` columns with semicolon-delimited address lists alongside the existing count columns
- `Summary.txt` external-members section now drills down to list specific external member emails under each affected group (with display name, role, and NestedVia when applicable), not just group names
- Added `Add-ExternalMemberSection` helper that produces the detailed per-group/per-member breakdown in `Summary.txt`
- Updated `Add-RiskSection` to display group display name + email rather than just the email address
- Added `Google/README.md` Future Enhancements section documenting six ideas for later: external-domain frequency table, permission impact for security groups, diff/change detection, nesting depth report, mail-flow risk overlay, owner-less stale group cleanup

### Google - Audit Google Groups (new)
- Added `Audit Google Groups.ps1` for tenant-wide Google Workspace group security audits
- Reuses the workspace-selection, transcript logging, internal-domain-list, and `Invoke-GamStream` heartbeat patterns from `Audit Shared Drive Folder.ps1`
- Inventories every group in three GAM calls:
  - `gam print groups` for email, name, description, member counts
  - `gam print cigroups labels` to classify each group as **Security**, **Email** (discussion forum / distribution), or **Both** based on Cloud Identity labels (`cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.security` and `cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.discussion_forum`)
  - `gam print groups settings` for access-control fields (`whoCanJoin`, `whoCanPostMessage`, `whoCanViewMembership`, `allowExternalMembers`, `archiveOnly`, `messageModerationLevel`); skippable via `-SkipSettings`
  - `gam print group-members` (optionally `recursive` via `-ExpandNestedGroups`) for membership rows
- Computes per-group internal vs external member counts using the configured comma-separated internal domain list (alias domains supported)
- Emits eight risk flag columns: `Risk_NoOwners`, `Risk_HasExternalMembers`, `Risk_ExternalOwners`, `Risk_PublicJoin`, `Risk_PublicPost`, `Risk_ExternalsAllowed`, `Risk_SecurityWithExternal`, `Risk_HasNestedGroups`
- Outputs three files: `Groups.csv` (one row per group), `GroupMembers.csv` (one row per (group, member) with internal/external classification), and `Summary.txt` (human-readable risk highlights with up to 50 examples per category)
- Updated `Google/README.md` script index

## 2026-04-18

### Google - Audit Shared Drive Folder
- **Major reliability rework** for very large Drive trees that previously appeared to hang for hours
- Replaced the single buffered `gam print diskusage` + `gam print filelist` walks (which held the full result set in memory and produced no output until completion) with a streaming, checkpointed, per-subtree architecture:
  - **Step 1**: enumerate the audited folder's immediate children with one fast API call to build a work list
  - **Step 2**: walk each child subtree independently with `gam print filelist`, streaming each row to a per-subtree CSV in `_subtrees/` as it arrives; print a heartbeat every 30 seconds with rows-written and rows-per-minute
  - **Step 2.5**: merge per-subtree CSVs into the unified `FileDetails.csv`, deduplicating by file ID
  - **Step 2.6**: derive `FolderDetails.csv` locally in PowerShell from the file list (eliminates the second slow API walk that the prior version's diskusage step performed)
- Added `audit.state.json` checkpoint file written after every subtree completes; tracks per-subtree status (pending / in-progress / done / failed)
- Added `-Resume` and `-Restart` switches; when neither is supplied and a state file is detected, the script prompts interactively (Yes / No / Quit) so re-running against the same OutputDir never silently destroys data
- An interrupted run (Ctrl+C, reboot, network drop) leaves a `.partial` file behind so the partially-streamed subtree can be re-walked on resume without confusion
- Console output during long walks now shows per-subtree progress (`[5/120] FolderName`, ID, row count, heartbeat) instead of going silent for hours
- Verified Google Drive API limits: 12,000 queries/60s/user (no daily cap); GAM walks one folder per API call, so wall-clock time scales with folder count, not file count

### Google - Audit Shared Drive Folder
- Added early detection for resource key-protected Google Drive folders (pre-September 2021 link-shared items)
- GAM7 does not send the `X-Goog-Drive-Resource-Keys` HTTP header required by the Drive API v3 for these folders, causing all API calls to return 404 Not Found
- When a resource key is detected, the script prompts for the folder owner's email, verifies access, and switches the impersonation target so the audit can proceed without re-running
- Clarified the user email prompt to indicate GAM will impersonate the supplied account
- Affects both folder ID (option 2) and Shared Drive ID (option 3) input paths
