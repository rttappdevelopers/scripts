# SYNOPSIS
#     Checks FileVault status and attempts to retrieve recovery key.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#     This script checks FileVault status and attempts to retrieve the recovery
#     key. Note: macOS does not provide a native command to retrieve the 
#     recovery key after FileVault is enabled. The key must be escrowed during
#     setup using an MDM solution or captured at enablement time.
#
# NOTES
#     Requires:
#     - macOS with FileVault enabled
#     - Root/sudo privileges
#     - Ninja RMM agent installed
