# Microsoft 365

Scripts for managing Microsoft 365 tenants. These run interactively from a **technician's workstation** — not via RMM — and use modern authentication only (`ExchangeOnlineManagement` v3+, `Microsoft.Graph`).

See [HOWTO.md](../HOWTO.md) for guidance on downloading and running scripts. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the M365 authentication rules and EOL module policy.
