## Command Reference

These are commands that one may find useful on Windows workstations and servers. The commands are a mix of DOS/CMD and PowerShell. The easiest way to tell them apart is that DOS commands will be in all capital letters, PowerShell will be mixed-case.

Many of these commands require an elevated command prompt or PowerShell terminal; run as Administrator. Note that any DOS command can be run in PowerShell, but PowerShell can't be run in the DOS command prompt without calling the PowerShell interpreter. If you are working from the DOS command prompt, you can run simple Powershell commands that don't include quotations using the exmaple below:
`powershell -c "Get-Volume C"`

Any text after a # in an example is a remark or comment, which explains what the command does.

# Filesystem Operations
##	Directories
**Change Directory**
```bat
CD \                    # Go to root directory of current drive
CD ..                   # Go back one directory
CD ..\..                # Layered to go back two directories
CD C:\Temp\             # Change directory to the Temp folder on the C: drive
CD "C:\Program Files\"  # Changing to a directory with spaces in the name requires quotes
```
**Print working directory**
```bat
CD       # In CMD, CD with no arguments prints the current path
```
```powershell
Get-Location  # PowerShell equivalent — also aliased as 'pwd' or 'gl'
```

**List Files**
```bat
DIR                    # List files in current directory
DIR /A                 # Include hidden and system files
DIR /S                 # Recursive listing including subdirectories
DIR /B                 # Bare format (names only, no headers)
DIR C:\Temp\*.log      # List files matching a pattern
```
```powershell
Get-ChildItem                        # List files and folders — also works as: ls, dir, gci
ls                                   # Works fine in PowerShell; aliases to Get-ChildItem
Get-ChildItem -Force                 # Include hidden items
Get-ChildItem -Recurse               # Recursive listing
Get-ChildItem -Filter "*.log"        # Filter by name pattern
Get-ChildItem -File                  # Files only
Get-ChildItem -Directory             # Folders only
```

## Common locations and their aliases
To use these: %AppData% is the current user's full path to their appdata folder;
*e.g.: CD %AppData% = CD C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming*

- %AllUsersProfile% - Open the All User's Profile C:\ProgramData
- %AppData% - Opens AppData folder C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming
- %CommonProgramFiles% - C:\Program Files\Common Files
- %CommonProgramFiles(x86)% - C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files
- %HomeDrive% - Opens your home drive C:\
- %LocalAppData% - Opens local AppData folder C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local
- %ProgramData% - C:\ProgramData
- %ProgramFiles% - C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)
- %ProgramFiles(x86)% - C:\Program Files (x86)
- %Public% - C:\Users\Public
- %SystemDrive% - C:
- %SystemRoot% - Opens Windows folder C:\Windows
- %Temp% - Opens temporary file Folder C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Temp
- %UserProfile% - Opens your user's profile C:\Users\{username}
- %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup - Opens Windows 10 Startup location for program shortcuts
- ~ - In PowerShell, the tilde can be used as the user's home director, just like in Linux: CD ~

## File operations
**View file contents**
```bat
TYPE filename.txt               # Print a file's contents to the terminal
MORE filename.txt               # Paginate output — press Space to advance
```
```powershell
Get-Content filename.txt        # Print file contents (alias: cat, gc)
Get-Content filename.txt | More # Paginate output
```

**Find**
```bat
DIR /S /B "filename.txt"        # Search for a file by name recursively
FINDSTR "search text" file.txt  # Search file contents for a string (like grep)
FINDSTR /S /I "text" *.log      # Recursive, case-insensitive content search
```
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "filename.txt"              # Find file by name
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*.log" }  # Pattern match
Select-String -Path "*.log" -Pattern "error" -Recurse      # Search file contents
```

**Edit**
```bat
NOTEPAD filename.txt    # Open file in Notepad (from CMD or Run dialog)
```
```powershell
notepad filename.txt    # Open in Notepad
code filename.txt       # Open in VS Code (if installed)
# Append a line to a file:

```

**Copy, Move, Delete**
```bat
COPY source.txt dest.txt        # Copy a file
XCOPY source\ dest\ /E /I      # Copy a folder tree (/E = include empty dirs)

MOVE source.txt C:\dest\        # Move a file
DEL filename.txt                # Delete a file
RD /S /Q foldername             # Delete a folder and all its contents
```
```powershell
Copy-Item source.txt dest.txt                        # Copy file
Copy-Item source\ dest\ -Recurse                    # Copy folder tree

## Services
```powershell
# Get-Service cmdlet
Get-Service                                  # List all services
Get-Service {service}                        # Get service status by name
Get-Service {service} | Start-Service        # Start the service
Get-Service {service} | Stop-Service         # Stop the service
Get-Service {service} | Restart-Service      # Restart the service

##	Process list
```powershell
get-process                                   # List all processes
get-process -Name "Notepad"                   # Get processes named Notepad
get-process -Name "*notepad*"                 # Get process info for applications with Notepad in their name
```

##	Kill
```powershell
Stop-Process 26152                            # Kill the process with ID #26152, identified above with get-process
Stop-Process -Name "Notepad"                  # Kill the processes named Notepad
get-process -Name "*notepad*" | Stop-Process  # Get and kill the processes with Notepad in their name
```

## Aliases
Windows supports filesystem aliases (junctions and symlinks) similar to Linux symlinks. These let you create a shortcut path that points to another folder — useful for redirecting legacy paths without moving data.
```bat
# Create a junction — a directory alias pointing to another folder on the same volume
MKLINK /J C:\OldPath C:\NewPath

# Create a directory symbolic link — works across volumes, requires admin
MKLINK /D C:\LinkFolder C:\Target

# List junctions/symlinks in a directory
DIR /AL C:\SomePath         # /AL shows only reparse points (junctions and symlinks)
```
```powershell
# Create via New-Item
New-Item -ItemType Junction    -Path C:\OldPath    -Target C:\NewPath
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path C:\LinkFolder -Target C:\Target

# Find all junctions and symlinks under a path
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.Attributes -match 'ReparsePoint' }
```
For **shell command aliases** (mapping one command name to another), see PowerShell's `Get-Alias` / `Set-Alias`.

## Connected Devices
```powershell
Get-PnpDevice                                     # List all Plug-and-Play devices
Get-PnpDevice -PresentOnly                        # Only devices currently connected
Get-PnpDevice -Class USB                          # USB devices only
Get-PnpDevice | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Error' }  # Devices with errors
```
```bat
DEVMGMT.MSC     # Open Device Manager (GUI)
```

# Network
## LAN IP
```powershell
Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Where-Object { $_.IPAddress -notlike "127.*" }
(Get-NetIPConfiguration).IPv4Address.IPAddress  # Quick one-liner
```
```bat
IPCONFIG                  # Full adapter details
IPCONFIG /ALL             # Includes MAC address, DHCP server, DNS servers
```

## WAN IP
```powershell
(Invoke-RestMethod "https://ifconfig.me/ip").Trim()         # Quick WAN IP lookup
(Invoke-WebRequest "https://api.ipify.org").Content.Trim()
```

## Domain Name Lookup and DNS Records
```powershell
Resolve-DnsName google.com              # DNS lookup (supports A, MX, TXT, PTR, etc.)
Resolve-DnsName google.com -Type MX    # Get MX records
Resolve-DnsName google.com -Type TXT   # Get TXT/SPF records
Resolve-DnsName 8.8.8.8                # Reverse lookup (PTR)
```
```bat
NSLOOKUP google.com                    # Forward lookup
NSLOOKUP -type=MX google.com          # MX record lookup
NSLOOKUP -type=TXT google.com         # TXT record lookup
```

## Who owns an IP or domain
```powershell
# PowerShell has no built-in whois — use an external tool or online lookup
# With Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
whois 8.8.8.8
# Or use the ARIN REST API:
(Invoke-RestMethod "https://rdap.arin.net/registry/ip/8.8.8.8").handle
```
```bat
WHOIS 8.8.8.8       # Requires Sysinternals whois.exe in PATH
                    # Download: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/whois
```

## Where is an IP from
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "https://ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8"       # Returns JSON with city, region, org
(Invoke-RestMethod "https://ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8/country").Trim()
```

## Who is on the network, are they reachable?
```powershell
Test-Connection 192.168.1.1 -Count 4         # Ping (PowerShell equivalent)
Test-Connection 192.168.1.1 -Quiet           # Returns True/False only
Test-NetConnection 192.168.1.1 -Port 443     # Test TCP port reachability
1..254 | ForEach-Object { Test-Connection "192.168.1.$_" -Count 1 -Quiet -AsJob }
# Then check arp table:
arp -a                                       # Show ARP cache (known LAN IPs and MACs)
```
```bat
PING 192.168.1.1              # Basic ping
PING -n 1 192.168.1.1         # Single ping
ARP -A                        # Show ARP table
```

## Scan a Port
```powershell
Test-NetConnection 192.168.1.1 -Port 3389   # Test if RDP port is open
Test-NetConnection smtp.office365.com -Port 587  # Test SMTP port
```

## Remote Command Line
```powershell
# PowerShell Remoting (WinRM)
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName server01                   # Interactive remote session
Invoke-Command -ComputerName server01 -ScriptBlock { Get-Service }  # Run command remotely
Invoke-Command -ComputerName server01 -FilePath script.ps1          # Run script remotely

# SSH (available on Windows 10+ and Server 2019+)
ssh user@server01                      # Open SSH session
ssh user@server01 "Get-Process"        # Run a single command via SSH
```
```bat
MSTSC /v:192.168.1.100        # Open RDP to an IP address
PSEXEC \\computername cmd.exe # Remote CMD via Sysinternals PsExec
```

## Get Files from the Internet
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri {URL} -OutFile C:\Temp\filename.ext  # Download a file
Start-BitsTransfer -Source {URL} -Destination C:\Temp\      # BITS transfer (resumable)
```
```bat
curl -o C:\Temp\file.ext {URL}   # curl is available in Windows 10+ CMD
```

## Install Applications with winget
winget is the Windows Package Manager, built into Windows 10 (1809+) and Windows 11. A quick alternative to Ninite for common app installs.

**Install individual apps**

> `--silent` suppresses the installer UI and progress. Remove it to see the normal installer window.  
> `--accept-package-agreements` and `--accept-source-agreements` are required to skip license prompts — keep these even without `--silent`.

```bat
winget install --id Google.Chrome             --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
winget install --id Mozilla.Firefox           --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
winget install --id Zoom.Zoom                 --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
winget install --id SlackTechnologies.Slack   --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
winget install --id Dialpad.Dialpad           --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
winget install --id Microsoft.Teams          --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements --override "/quiet NOLAUNCH=1"
winget install --id 7zip.7zip                 --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
winget install --id Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.8 --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
winget install --id Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64      --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
```

**Install all of the above in one go**
```powershell
$apps = @(
    "Google.Chrome",
    "Mozilla.Firefox",
    "Zoom.Zoom",
    "SlackTechnologies.Slack",
    "Dialpad.Dialpad",
    "Microsoft.Teams",
    "7zip.7zip",
    "Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.8",
    "Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64"
)
foreach ($app in $apps) {
    $extra = if ($app -eq "Microsoft.Teams") { "--override '/quiet NOLAUNCH=1'" } else { "" }
    winget install --id $app --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements $extra
}
```

**Install all of the above as a one-liner**
```powershell
# With installer UI suppressed (silent)
"Google.Chrome","Mozilla.Firefox","Zoom.Zoom","SlackTechnologies.Slack","Dialpad.Dialpad","Microsoft.Teams","7zip.7zip","Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.8","Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64" | ForEach-Object { winget install --id $_ --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements }

# With installer UI visible (interactive)
"Google.Chrome","Mozilla.Firefox","Zoom.Zoom","SlackTechnologies.Slack","Dialpad.Dialpad","Microsoft.Teams","7zip.7zip","Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.8","Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64" | ForEach-Object { winget install --id $_ --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements }
```

**Engineer / sysadmin add-ons** (VS Code, Notepad++, Python 3)
```powershell
# Silent
"Microsoft.VisualStudioCode","Notepad++.Notepad++","Python.Python.3.13" | ForEach-Object { winget install --id $_ --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements }

# Interactive
"Microsoft.VisualStudioCode","Notepad++.Notepad++","Python.Python.3.13" | ForEach-Object { winget install --id $_ --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements }
```

**Other useful winget commands**
```bat
winget list                        # Show all installed apps winget knows about
winget upgrade --all --silent      # Update every app winget can manage
winget upgrade --id Google.Chrome  # Update a specific app
winget uninstall --id Zoom.Zoom    # Uninstall an app
winget search "zoom"               # Search for a package by name
```
