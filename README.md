# About
This repository allows us to share useful terminal commands and scripts for the management of Windows, Mac and Linux systems, and hosted platforms that can be managed by scrips or API calls.

Each platform can be found in its own folder, each folder containing a README that provides some basic command knowledge, and script files that can automate a series of actions.

This is an ongoing project, check back often to see new stuff. Our team is encouraged to contribute, but please ensure your code is commented, and the filenames adhere to the common formatting.
